# sever-extension-dotnet
Server extensions allow developers to change and extend the capabilities of ArcGIS Server map and 
image services. This project provides a template intended to bootstrap the development of both types of .NET-based 
server extensions, Server Object Extensions (SOEs) and Server Object Interceptors (SOIs). In general, this project limits itself to 
REST server extensions.

## Features
* SimplifyMapContentsSOI - A sample SOI that allows you to author a map with multiple layers but only exposes one layer in the map service REST resources to keep the web clients user experience simpler
     e.g. https://livefeeds2.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/NFIE/NationalWaterModel_Medium_Anomaly/MapServer has only one layer in its root resources but the source map document (.mxd) has 5 layers representing details streams at varying level.
     In addition to that the SOI does following:
          (b) the [legend](http://livefeeds2.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/NFIE/NationalWaterModel_Medium_Anomaly/MapServer/legend) is customized for REST output whereas the layer in the source map document authored with multi-field unique value renderer.
          (c) spatial query requests always get redirected to the layer with most details level of stream and returns only one stream feature (with highest order) even though there may be more than 1 streams are found.
